    <h1>As a devoted UX designer, I thrive on creating impactful user experiences.</h1>
    <p>While deeply rooted in user-centered design principles, I'm increasingly intrigued by More-than-Human Design, recognizing the significance of considering non-human impacts. My journey is fueled by the excitement of uncovering user needs through research.</p>

    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>Passionate about creativity in all its forms, I find joy in expressing myself through various art mediums – from painting and sketching to jewelry making, photography and sculpting. I also enjoy exploring digital art and experimenting with 3D models. Alongside my artistic pursuits, I'm dedicated to advancing my education, recently achieving a milestone with a paper acceptance at the IEEE VR conference. Beyond that, I indulge in the culinary arts, finding solace in cooking and baking. I am also a proud cat enthusiast.</p>
